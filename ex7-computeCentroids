function centroids = computeCentroids(X, idx, K)
%COMPUTECENTROIDS returns the new centroids by computing the means of the 
%data points assigned to each centroid.
%   centroids = COMPUTECENTROIDS(X, idx, K) returns the new centroids by 
%   computing the means of the data points assigned to each centroid. It is
%   given a dataset X where each row is a single data point, a vector
%   idx of centroid assignments (i.e. each entry in range [1..K]) for each
%   example, and K, the number of centroids. You should return a matrix
%   centroids, where each row of centroids is the mean of the data points
%   assigned to it.
%

% Useful variables
[m n] = size(X);

% You need to return the following variables correctly.
centroids = zeros(K, n);


% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Go over every centroid and compute mean of all points that
%               belong to it. Concretely, the row vector centroids(i, :)
%               should contain the mean of the data points assigned to
%               centroid i.
%
% Note: You can use a for-loop over the centroids to compute this.
%

for i=1:K
  sum=0;
  temp=find(idx==i);
  for j=1:length(temp),
    sum=sum+X(temp(j),:);
end
centroids(i,:)=sum/length(temp);
end

%另一种解法，代码更简洁??
%for?i?=?1:K??
%X'?*?(idx?==?i)?——>使X中不是对应i的其他无关行置0，从而使挑出的X(i)行对应相加，最后变为(1*2)????
%centroids(i,:)?=?(X'?*?(idx?==?i))?/?sum(idx?==?i);?????
%end???
